ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
------------------
The San Francisco governmentâ€™s website has a public data source of food trucks (https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b). The data can be accessed in a number of forms, including JSON, CSV, and XML. How you access the data is up to you, but you can find some useful information about making an API request to this data source here (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.sfgov.org/jjew-r69b).

This command line program prints out a list of food trucks that are open at the current date and current time, when the program is being run. If the program is run at noon on a Friday, the program will print a list of all the food trucks that are open then.

The program displays 10 trucks per page. That is: if there are more than 10 food trucks open, the program should display the first 10, then wait for input from the user before displaying the next 10 (or fewer if there are fewer than 10 remaining), and so on until there are no more food trucks to display. 

The program displays the name and address of the trucks and sorts the output alphabetically by name.
